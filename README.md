# Space Invaders Clone


### Project Information

- Project was made as initial programming "show-off". It lacks "polish", but it's core mechanics are implemented.
- It's free to use for everyone, but you have to implement me as an author.
- This particular build was meant to work on android devices, although it could be easily converted for whatever (Keep in mind that you have to delete Exit button on IOS devices, beacuse it could result in crash)
- It could have been written better, but it was a challenge for me, to make it as fast as i could, delivering something that will be as satisfying as it could be, for something this trivial.
- I've made core game in about a day and a half, debugging it and testing for deployment, aswell working on GUI took me approximately 2 days.


### Packages I used

- git extension for Unity (obviously)
- Android LogCat (without it, debugging in Unity Remote 5 is straight impossible)

### Conclussion

I am a bit proud of myself, and even suprised. Testing this game with my close friends showed me that even this trivial concept can be playable and satisfying to some extent.
